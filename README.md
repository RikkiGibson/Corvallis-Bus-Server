## Corvallis Bus Server

The backend that powers the best apps for the Corvallis Transit System.

## Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2015
- Azure Account

## Purpose

To have a more convenient way to get real-time information about the free buses in Corvallis.  Data from CTS (basically, huge chunks of XML) is mapped into some more easily-digestable JSON for different use cases.

## User Stories Covered

1. As a student, I want to know when the route I take to school will be at my stop.
2. As a teacher, I want to know when the next bus will be at my stop.
3. As a new resident, I want to see what the routes look like on my devices.

## Disclaimer

We assume no liability for any missed buses.  Buses may be erratic in their arrival behavior, and we cannot control that.

## Prerequisites for running

- Visual Studio 2015

## Purpose

To have a more convenient way to get real-time information about the free buses in Corvallis.  Data from CTS is merged with data from Google Transit, with some convenient projections applied, and mapped into some easily-digestable JSON for different use cases.

## Disclaimer

We assume no liability for any missed buses.  Buses may be erratic in their arrival behavior, and we cannot control that.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available via [PostMan Docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1830246/collection/7LgFmXw)!
